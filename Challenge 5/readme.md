# Challenge 5: ðŸ›· Santa's CyberTruck

![The CyberTruck](../imgs/challenge5.jpg)

Santa ðŸŽ… is testing his new electric sled, the CyberReindeer, on a North Pole road. The road is represented by a string of characters, where:

* . = Road
* S = Santa's Sled
* \* = Open barrier
* | = Closed barrier

Example of a road: S...|....|.....

Each unit of time, the sled moves one position to the right. If it encounters a closed barrier, it stops until the barrier opens. If it is open, it goes through directly.

All barriers start closed, but after 5 units of time, they all open forever.

Create a function that simulates the sled's movement for a given time and returns an array of strings representing the state of the road at each unit of time:

```JavaScript
const road = 'S..|...|..'
const time = 10 // units of time
const result = cyberReindeer(road, time)

/* -> result:
[
  'S..|...|..', // initial state
  '.S.|...|..', // sled advances on the road
  '..S|...|..', // sled advances on the road
  '..S|...|..', // sled stops at the barrier
  '..S|...|..', // sled stops at the barrier
  '...S...*..', // barrier opens, sled advances
  '...*S..*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*.S.*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*..S*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*...S..', // passes through the open barrier
]
*/
```

The result is an array where each element shows the road at each unit of time.

Take into account that if the sled is in the same position as a barrier, then it takes its place in the array.

The elves were inspired by this Code Wars challenge.
